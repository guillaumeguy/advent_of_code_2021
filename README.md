# Advent of Code 2021 in C++
My attempt at AoC in C++

# Context
2021 was a very fun adventure and I got to get my hands dirty (I really enjoy coding and problem solving). 

I tried to solve most problems with a good solution. In some instances, I challenged myself to write high performance code and these solutions are suffixed with `_opti`.

# Run me
The code start with `main.cpp`. Change the `#include` to the day you are interested in running.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
